> 1. Don't study for too long if you are not enjoying it. Take short breaks after 20-30 minutes.
>
> 2. Don't study in the living room, bedroom, etc. Study in a separate place dedicated to studying.
> 3. Don't try to memorize without understanding. Try to understand the concept first.
> 4. Don't always study alone. Studying in groups helps a lot. 
> 5. Don't highlight text blindly. Highlighting doesn't help that much. It only indicates Recognization not Recollection of the topic. 
> 6. Always take notes. Reviewing the notes after a short time helps a lot. 
> 7. Always try to teach others what you have learned. Teaching is the best way of learning. 
> 8. Sleep is so much important for pushing something into your long-term memory. Get at least 7-8 hours of sound sleep. 
> 9. Use the SQ3R(survey, question, recite, read, review) method while studying. 
> 10. Use Mnemonics. It's the best way to memorize facts.
